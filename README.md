# Covid-19-Data-Modelling

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to conduct Data Analysis with JHU Covid-19 Dataset. The primary objective is to answer Analytical Questions around Vaccination effectivesness and Policy Making around Mask usage. We discuss the potential impact of Vaccination on the count of Confirmed Covid-19 Cases in the states of Virginia, Maryland and Massachussets. Followed by this we take a look at how mask policy affected the Covid-19 spread, by comparing New York and Texas confirmed cases after 15th April, 2020. The aim of the project is to come up with data-driven insights for better policy making and governance

1. How does government regulation effect spread of covid 19?

2. What is the effectiveness of vaccine
3. During thanksgiving holidays and Christmas holiday 2020, did cases/ death increase significantly?
4. Explore how the mask policy affected the covid-19 spread by comparing NY and TX confirmed cases after 4/15/2020 NY started to mandate mask outdoor



(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- Bulk Loading
- Data processing/cleaning
- Data exploration/Descriptive statistics
-
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
